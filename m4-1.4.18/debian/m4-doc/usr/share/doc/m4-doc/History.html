<p>Macro languages were invented early in the history of computing.  In the
1950s Alan Perlis suggested that the macro language be independent of the
language being processed.  Techniques such as conditional and recursive
macros, and using macros to define other macros, were described by Doug
McIlroy of Bell Labs in &ldquo;Macro Instruction Extensions of Compiler
Languages&rdquo;, <em>Communications of the ACM</em> 3, 4 (1960), 214&ndash;20,
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/367177.367223">http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/367177.367223</a>.
</p>
<p>An important precursor of <code>m4</code> was GPM; see C. Strachey,
&ldquo;A general purpose macrogenerator&rdquo;, <em>Computer Journal</em> 8, 3
(1965), 225&ndash;41, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/8.3.225">http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/8.3.225</a>.  GPM is
also succinctly described in David Gries&rsquo;s book <em>Compiler
Construction for Digital Computers</em>, Wiley (1971).  Strachey was a
brilliant programmer: GPM fit into 250 machine instructions!
</p>
<p>Inspired by GPM while visiting Strachey&rsquo;s Lab in 1968, McIlroy wrote a
model preprocessor in that fit into a page of Snobol 3 code, and McIlroy
and Robert Morris developed a series of further models at Bell Labs.
Andrew D. Hall followed up with M6, a general purpose macro processor
used to port the Fortran source code of the Altran computer algebra
system; see Hall&rsquo;s &ldquo;The M6 Macro Processor&rdquo;, Computing Science
Technical Report #2, Bell Labs (1972),
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr/2.pdf">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr/2.pdf</a>.  M6&rsquo;s source code
consisted of about 600 Fortran statements.  Its name was the first of
the <code>m4</code> line.
</p>
<p>The Brian Kernighan and P.J. Plauger book <em>Software Tools</em>,
Addison-Wesley (1976), describes and implements a Unix
macro-processor language, which inspired Dennis Ritchie to write
<code>m3</code>, a macro processor for the AP-3 minicomputer.
</p>
<p>Kernighan and Ritchie then joined forces to develop the original
<code>m4</code>, described in &ldquo;The M4 Macro Processor&rdquo;, Bell Laboratories
(1977), <a href="http://wolfram.schneider.org/bsd/7thEdManVol2/m4/m4.pdf">http://wolfram.schneider.org/bsd/7thEdManVol2/m4/m4.pdf</a>.
It had only 21 builtin macros.
</p>
<p>While <code>GPM</code> was more <em>pure</em>, <code>m4</code> is meant to deal with
the true intricacies of real life: macros can be recognized without
being pre-announced, skipping whitespace or end-of-lines is easier,
more constructs are builtin instead of derived, etc.
</p>
<p>Originally, the Kernighan and Plauger macro-processor, and then
<code>m3</code>, formed the engine for the Rational FORTRAN preprocessor,
that is, the <code>Ratfor</code> equivalent of <code>cpp</code>.  Later, <code>m4</code>
was used as a front-end for <code>Ratfor</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>Cobol</code>.
</p>
<p>Ren&eacute; Seindal released his implementation of <code>m4</code>, GNU
<code>m4</code>,
in 1990, with the aim of removing the artificial limitations in many
of the traditional <code>m4</code> implementations, such as maximum line
length, macro size, or number of macros.
</p>
<p>The late Professor A. Dain Samples described and implemented a further
evolution in the form of <code>M5</code>: &ldquo;User&rsquo;s Guide to the M5 Macro
Language: 2nd edition&rdquo;, Electronic Announcement on comp.compilers
newsgroup (1992).
</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Pinard took over maintenance of GNU <code>m4</code> in
1992, until 1994 when he released GNU <code>m4</code> 1.4, which was
the stable release for 10 years.  It was at this time that GNU
Autoconf decided to require GNU <code>m4</code> as its underlying
engine, since all other implementations of <code>m4</code> had too many
limitations.
</p>
<p>More recently, in 2004, Paul Eggert released 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 which
addressed some long standing bugs in the venerable 1.4 release.  Then in
2005, Gary V. Vaughan collected together the many patches to
GNU <code>m4</code> 1.4 that were floating around the net and
released 1.4.3 and 1.4.4.  And in 2006, Eric Blake joined the team and
prepared patches for the release of 1.4.5, with subsequent releases
through intervening years, as recent as 1.4.18 in 2016.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, development has continued on new features for <code>m4</code>, such
as dynamic module loading and additional builtins.  When complete,
GNU <code>m4</code> 2.0 will start a new series of releases.
