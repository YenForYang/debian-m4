<h3 class="section">16.2 Facilities in System V <code>m4</code> not in GNU <code>m4</code></h3>

<p>The version of <code>m4</code> from System V contains a few facilities that
have not been implemented in GNU <code>m4</code> yet.  Additionally,
POSIX requires some behaviors that GNU <code>m4</code> has not
implemented yet.  Relying on these behaviors is non-portable, as a
future release of GNU <code>m4</code> may change.
</p>
<ul>
<li> POSIX requires support for multiple arguments to <code>defn</code>,
without any clarification on how <code>defn</code> behaves when one of the
multiple arguments names a builtin.  System V <code>m4</code> and some other
implementations allow mixing builtins and text macros into a single
macro.  GNU <code>m4</code> only supports joining multiple text
arguments, although a future implementation may lift this restriction to
behave more like System V.  The only portable way to join text macros
with builtins is via helper macros and implicit concatenation of macro
results.

</li><li> POSIX requires an application to exit with non-zero status if
it wrote an error message to stderr.  This has not yet been consistently
implemented for the various builtins that are required to issue an error
(such as <code>eval</code> (see <a href="Eval.html#Eval">Eval</a>) when an argument cannot be parsed).

</li><li> Some traditional implementations only allow reading standard input
once, but GNU <code>m4</code> correctly handles multiple instances
of &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo; on the command line.

</li><li> POSIX requires <code>m4wrap</code> (see <a href="M4wrap.html#M4wrap">M4wrap</a>) to act in FIFO
(first-in, first-out) order, but GNU <code>m4</code> currently uses
LIFO order.  Furthermore, POSIX states that only the first
argument to <code>m4wrap</code> is saved for later evaluation, but
GNU <code>m4</code> saves and processes all arguments, with output
separated by spaces.

</li><li> POSIX states that builtins that require arguments, but are
called without arguments, have undefined behavior.  Traditional
implementations simply behave as though empty strings had been passed.
For example, <code>a`'define`'b</code> would expand to <code>ab</code>.  But
GNU <code>m4</code> ignores certain builtins if they have missing
arguments, giving <code>adefineb</code> for the above example.

</li><li> Traditional implementations handle <code>define(`f',`1')</code> (see <a href="Define.html#Define">Define</a>)
by undefining the entire stack of previous definitions, and if doing
<code>undefine(`f')</code> first.  GNU <code>m4</code> replaces just the top
definition on the stack, as if doing <code>popdef(`f')</code> followed by
<code>pushdef(`f',`1')</code>.  POSIX allows either behavior.

</li><li> POSIX 2001 requires <code>syscmd</code> (see <a href="Syscmd.html#Syscmd">Syscmd</a>) to evaluate
command output for macro expansion, but this was a mistake that is
anticipated to be corrected in the next version of POSIX.
GNU <code>m4</code> follows traditional behavior in <code>syscmd</code>
where output is not rescanned, and provides the extension <code>esyscmd</code>
that does scan the output.

</li><li> At one point, POSIX required <code>changequote(<var>arg</var>)</code>
(see <a href="Changequote.html#Changequote">Changequote</a>) to use newline as the close quote, but this was a
bug, and the next version of POSIX is anticipated to state
that using empty strings or just one argument is unspecified.
Meanwhile, the GNU <code>m4</code> behavior of treating an empty
end-quote delimiter as &lsquo;<samp>'</samp>&rsquo; is not portable, as Solaris treats it as
repeating the start-quote delimiter, and BSD treats it as leaving the
previous end-quote delimiter unchanged.  For predictable results, never
call changequote with just one argument, or with empty strings for
arguments.

</li><li> At one point, POSIX required <code>changecom(<var>arg</var>,)</code>
(see <a href="Changecom.html#Changecom">Changecom</a>) to make it impossible to end a comment, but this is
a bug, and the next version of POSIX is anticipated to state
that using empty strings is unspecified.  Meanwhile, the GNU
<code>m4</code> behavior of treating an empty end-comment delimiter as newline
is not portable, as BSD treats it as leaving the previous end-comment
delimiter unchanged.  It is also impossible in BSD implementations to
disable comments, even though that is required by POSIX.  For
predictable results, never call changecom with empty strings for
arguments.

</li><li> Most implementations of <code>m4</code> give macros a higher precedence than
comments when parsing, meaning that if the start delimiter given to
<code>changecom</code> (see <a href="Changecom.html#Changecom">Changecom</a>) starts with a macro name, comments
are effectively disabled.  POSIX does not specify what the
precedence is, so this version of GNU <code>m4</code> parser
recognizes comments, then macros, then quoted strings.

</li><li> Traditional implementations allow argument collection, but not string
and comment processing, to span file boundaries.  Thus, if <samp>a.m4</samp>
contains &lsquo;<samp>len(</samp>&rsquo;, and <samp>b.m4</samp> contains &lsquo;<samp>abc)</samp>&rsquo;,
<kbd>m4 a.m4 b.m4</kbd> outputs &lsquo;<samp>3</samp>&rsquo; with traditional <code>m4</code>, but
gives an error message that the end of file was encountered inside a
macro with GNU <code>m4</code>.  On the other hand, traditional
implementations do end of file processing for files included with
<code>include</code> or <code>sinclude</code> (see <a href="Include.html#Include">Include</a>), while GNU
<code>m4</code> seamlessly integrates the content of those files.  Thus
<code>include(`a.m4')include(`b.m4')</code> will output &lsquo;<samp>3</samp>&rsquo; instead of
giving an error.

</li><li> Traditional <code>m4</code> treats <code>traceon</code> (see <a href="Trace.html#Trace">Trace</a>) without
arguments as a global variable, independent of named macro tracing.
Also, once a macro is undefined, named tracing of that macro is lost.
On the other hand, when GNU <code>m4</code> encounters
<code>traceon</code> without
arguments, it turns tracing on for all existing definitions at the time,
but does not trace future definitions; <code>traceoff</code> without arguments
turns tracing off for all definitions regardless of whether they were
also traced by name; and tracing by name, such as with <samp>-tfoo</samp> at
the command line or <code>traceon(`foo')</code> in the input, is an attribute
that is preserved even if the macro is currently undefined.

<p>Additionally, while POSIX requires trace output, it makes no
demands on the formatting of that output.  Parsing trace output is not
guaranteed to be reliable, even between different releases of
GNU M4; however, the intent is that any future changes in
trace output will only occur under the direction of additional
<code>debugmode</code> flags (see <a href="Debug-Levels.html#Debug-Levels">Debug Levels</a>).
</p>
</li><li> POSIX requires <code>eval</code> (see <a href="Eval.html#Eval">Eval</a>) to treat all
operators with the same precedence as C.  However, earlier versions of
GNU <code>m4</code> followed the traditional behavior of other
<code>m4</code> implementations, where bitwise and logical negation (&lsquo;<samp>~</samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp>!</samp>&rsquo;) have lower precedence than equality operators; and where
equality operators (&lsquo;<samp>==</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>!=</samp>&rsquo;) had the same precedence as
relational operators (such as &lsquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rsquo;).  Use explicit parentheses to
ensure proper precedence.  As extensions to POSIX,
GNU <code>m4</code> gives well-defined semantics to operations that
C leaves undefined, such as when overflow occurs, when shifting negative
numbers, or when performing division by zero.  POSIX also
requires &lsquo;<samp>=</samp>&rsquo; to cause an error, but many traditional
implementations allowed it as an alias for &lsquo;<samp>==</samp>&rsquo;.

</li><li> POSIX 2001 requires <code>translit</code> (see <a href="Translit.html#Translit">Translit</a>) to
treat each character of the second and third arguments literally.
However, it is anticipated that the next version of POSIX will
allow the GNU <code>m4</code> behavior of treating &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo; as a
range operator.

</li><li> POSIX requires <code>m4</code> to honor the locale environment
variables of <code>LANG</code>, <code>LC_ALL</code>, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>,
<code>LC_MESSAGES</code>, and <code>NLSPATH</code>, but this has not yet been
implemented in GNU <code>m4</code>.

</li><li> POSIX states that only unquoted leading newlines and blanks
(that is, space and tab) are ignored when collecting macro arguments.
However, this appears to be a bug in POSIX, since most
traditional implementations also ignore all whitespace (formfeed,
carriage return, and vertical tab).  GNU <code>m4</code> follows
tradition and ignores all leading unquoted whitespace.

</li><li> <a name="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-1"></a>
A strictly-compliant POSIX client is not allowed to use
command-line arguments not specified by POSIX.  However, since
this version of M4 ignores <code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code> and enables the option
<code>--gnu</code> by default (see <a href="Limits-control.html#Limits-control">Invoking m4</a>), a
client desiring to be strictly compliant has no way to disable
GNU extensions that conflict with POSIX when
directly invoking the compiled <code>m4</code>.  A future version of
<code>GNU</code> M4 will honor the environment variable <code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code>,
implicitly enabling <samp>--traditional</samp> if it is set, in order to
allow a strictly-compliant client.  In the meantime, a client needing
strict POSIX compliance can use the workaround of invoking a
shell script wrapper, where the wrapper then adds <samp>--traditional</samp>
to the arguments passed to the compiled <code>m4</code>.
</li></ul>
